            <h2>About Zein Ahmed</h2>
            <img src="zein.png">
            <ul>
              <li>Zein Ahmed’s journey with ethical design began nearly three decades ago in Lahore. This was the early 1990s,
                and it marked the beginning of her love for handloom textiles. In 1998 Zein shifted to New York where she
                became part of the slow fashion movement, setting up her own clothing label, Guru. Her lifestyle range of
                linen tunics and dresses were borne out of that first impulse—classic silhouettes, crafted with urban flair,
                and based on social as well as environmentally conscious production modes.
              </li>
              <li>Zein works with a bold heart (and phenomenal speed). Making Life Matter, her new ensemble line, draws upon
                a year-long passion project with Sindh-based artisans. She has spent about 8 months in research, before launching
                production in January this year. The outcome—a limited edition show of 4, 8, and 12-panel kurtas, as well
                as short tunics, made with pure, breathable fabric.
              </li>
              <li>Inspired by the practice of ‘truest form,’ Zein engaged traditional, master craftsmen from the region—weaving
                ustad, Wazir Ali, and ajrak ustad, M. Riaz—in order to develop her base textiles. These were then crafted
                with embroidery by gifted Sukker-based artisans. ‘The textiles are so happy because of this!—these craftswomen
                claim what they are working on. 99%, their own ideas.’ Zein’s own guidance has been in terms of fabric quality,
                input on colour palette, minor feedback on works. </li>
              <li>Good design is then not about the surface of a garment alone. For this designer-entrepreneur, it is about a
                purity of practice from the ground up. Design, for Zein, resonates all stages of production and artisanal
                making. There’s something invisible here, in a tunic’s intimate feel. A transparent joy in adornment. Ethical
                excellence. - *Tankas or embroidery stitches include: hurmich, makri tanka, bharti tanka, kachi sui tanka,
                kundi, mirror work, and balochi tanka. *Block-print ustad M. Soomro, from Bhit Shah, worked with customised
                inks and blocks for the blockprint line.
